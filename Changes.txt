Changes:

Documentation is better structured, showcasing all test cases for each type of testing performed in the project.

Test cases in the project are separated in distinct folders for Unit Testing, Integration Testing and FX Testing (System Testing)

Entire Unit testing section added, utilizing mocks to ensure maximal isolation when testing every single unit. Normally, not every single test case was integrated as this project
is done single handedly. However, all methods for all classes are covered in integration testing.
