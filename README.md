# Project Structure

This project was originally completed in my second year as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming** course and has been refined this year as I am retaking Java.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

### Main Folder (`main`)
The `main` folder contains six key classes that form the core functionality of the application:
- **Administrator**
- **BillNumber**
- **Book**
- **Librarian**
- **Manager**
- **MainFx**

### Test Folder (`test`)
The `test` folder is the most crucial part of the project, as it contains all test cases. It is structured into three subfolders, each dedicated to a specific type of testing:
- **Unit Testing**
- **Integration Testing**
- **FX Testing** (also covering **system testing**)

This structured approach ensures **comprehensive validation** of the project's functionality and reliability.
