## Project Structure

This project was originally completed in my **second year** as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming** course and has been **refined this year** as I am **retaking Java**. 

The `src` folder is divided into two subfolders: **main** and **test**.

- The **main** folder contains six key classes:  
  **Administrator, BillNumber, Book, Librarian, Manager, and MainFx**, forming the core functionality of the application.

- The **test** folder is the most crucial part of the project, as it contains all **test cases**. It is structured into three subfolders, each dedicated to a specific type of testing:  
  - **Unit testing**  
  - **Integration testing**  
  - **FX testing**, which also covers **system testing**  

This structured approach ensures **comprehensive validation** of the project's functionality and reliability.

## Total Coverage and Conclusions

Running every single test that I had developed above with **coverage** left me with a **total coverage** as follows:
